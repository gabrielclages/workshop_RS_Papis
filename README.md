## Recommendation Systems Workshop

Summary:
 Recommender systems are the backbone of many businesses from Netflix to Twitter. In this advanced course, you will learn about Recommender Systems and how to train them. This includes working with large datasets, feature selection, and a deeper discussion of Wide & Deep Models. Implementations will be using Tensorflow and Tensorboard to monitor the computational graph.

Target audience/Requirements: 
This workshop is designed for data scientists and software developers with a basic understanding of ML/DL who would like to learn more about recommender systems. Familiarity with Python, linear algebra, neural networks and Tensorflow is advised. Attendees are expected to bring their own laptops for hands-on practical work.

Learning objectives:
Learning about how to leverage ML to determine the most relevant information for a particular individual
How (and why) to implement a Wide & Deep model
Learn about Embeddings and why we use them in Recommender Systems
Working with Tensorboard to understand, visualize and debug Tensorflow models
